# Python 101 (introduction to Python in neuroscience)

IRTG - RWTH Aachen - Python class 2018
The .py files of the class I gave in sept-oct 2017 and oct-nov 2018


## Course information:
**Level:** beginner. **Prerequisite:** Nothing, but each class is important to understand the next one. **Needed:** a computer with ipython and Atom installed (Anaconda package -free-) (see the file "python101_prerequisite.pdf" attached, note that I wrote it for Python 2.7 so add brackets after the function "print", ex: "print 2" won't work in Python 3, "print(2)" is appropriate, I will update the PDF asap). **Dates:** Tuesday (2 to 4pm), Irtg room, from 16th October to mid-November 2018.
